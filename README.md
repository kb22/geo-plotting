# Goe Plotting

This repository describes the use of GeoPandas in Python and Leaflet in R as two very elegant (and easy) ways to plot geomaps. This repository plots are based on World Population data taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/walla2ae/world-population).

## GeoPandas plot in Python

Geopandas enables us to generate static maps which are easy to generate. In this repo, we generate the geomap for the average population densities for the various countries around the world.

## Leaflet plot in R

Leaflet enables us to generate interactive plots which are highly informative with the use of markers, labels, highlights and more. In this repo, we generate interactive geomap for the average population densities for the various countries around the world.
